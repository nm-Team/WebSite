			<h1>Want to know the origin of nm? </h1>
			<p>XYZ1024 (self-proclaimed "self-learning robot") is a senior nm person. When someone sends a message in
				the Sakura Frp official group chat, XYZ1024 often responds in the form of "*nm". E.g:</p>
			<p>
				——How to use Mac with Android?</p>
			<p>
				——Use nm.</p>
			<p>
				Subsequently, the founder of nmTeam agou joined the nm army. He called himself an "autonomous nm robot",
				and carried forward the nm career, so he was removed from the group chat at 14:07 on May 29, 2020.</p>
			<p>
				When nmTeam was about to be founded, we chose the Chinese expression "Lemon" (or "Nano") for nm. </p>
			<p>
				All members of our nmTeam are loyal fans of nm, as a basis of which we are working hard to carry forward
				the nm culture! </p>
